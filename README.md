# payU-test
This code collects credit card details and its responses with a token.
It asks for extra information that is not relevant to generate the token, but it is useful to get the client's details such as email, billing address and phone.
For the layout, I have included bootstrap
I included jquery library to show the token or an error taking the information
CVV number is not necessary to generate the token, it can be asked or not. At the last commit, I have disabled the CVV request
